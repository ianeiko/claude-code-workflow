remove this, we're not using magic here

```
let's just make it langraph-expert, also update the name of this persona everywhere, change filenames if needed
```

```
remove specific 30sec time, instead let the architect find a reusable for when agent has failed or got stuck spinning on a task
```

```
why does this file even exist? all the content should be in .cluaude/personas.md only
```

### .claude/commands/geliz/examples.md:13

```
this should be langraph-expert
```

```
there's no dashboard to create, langgraph is a framework to create ai agents
```

### .claude/commands/geliz/examples.md:25

```
don't add hours or timeline at all
```

### .claude/commands/geliz/examples.md:33

```
remove all ui comments
```

```
none of these examples make sense, use c7 langgraph docs for relevant information. you can breakdown a starter template and see what the building blocks of an agent are
```

```
we do't need to monitor gh anymore, remove all this. the issue creation is the end. we don't need to record notes either. any feedback will be handles by a separate prompt
```

```
we don't need automation at this step. if pr is approved means we're done
```

### .claude/commands/geliz/dev-agent.md:12
**Author:** @ianeiko
**Date:** 2025-07-31T22:49:15Z

```
why does the dev create pull request? let's create a separate pr-creator.md, should use the `gh pr create --fill` command and provide a detailed description of the changes
```

```
I would prefer to break up the work into langchain-expert  + langchain-dev, the implementation plan is first created, the dev has a hyper specilized role to implement, make sure the code works, write and run tests, etc
```

```
front-end is not relevant at all here, this is langraph persona
```

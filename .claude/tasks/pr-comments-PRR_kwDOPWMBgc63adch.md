simplify this ignore all the PR creations, qa and other steps for now. we want to narrow down the scope only assume that persona-langgraph-expert has been reviewed and ready for usage. this command should reflect that. instead of starting from PR we will use the langraph-expert to produce a docs/prd.md file for planned work

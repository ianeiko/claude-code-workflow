# LangGraph Multi-Agent Workflow Examples

Comprehensive examples demonstrating the LangGraph multi-agent development workflow for different types of features and complexity levels.

## Quick Start Example

### Basic Feature Implementation

**Scenario:** Add a user dashboard with basic analytics

```bash
# 1. Start the workflow
/sc:langgraph "Create a user dashboard that displays basic analytics including page views, user count, and recent activity"

# The workflow will:
# - Analyze complexity (moderate)
# - Create GitHub issue with detailed requirements
# - Wait for human approval
# - Implement the feature autonomously
# - Run tests and fix failures
# - Create PR with QA analysis
# - Wait for human review
```

**Expected Timeline:** 2-4 hours
**Expected Complexity:** Moderate
**Required Personas:** architect, frontend, backend, qa

### Example 3: Full-Stack Feature with E2E Testing

**Feature Request:** "Create a real-time chat system with message history, user presence, and file sharing"

#### Phase 1: Orchestrator Analysis
```
Complexity Assessment: Complex
Required Personas: architect, frontend, backend, security, performance, qa
Estimated Duration: 12-16 hours
Key Components: WebSocket integration, real-time UI, file handling, database optimization
Special Considerations: Performance critical, requires E2E testing
```

#### Phase 2: Implementation Highlights

**Frontend (React + WebSocket):**
```typescript
// Real-time chat component with optimistic updates
const ChatRoom: React.FC<ChatRoomProps> = ({ roomId }) => {
  const { messages, sendMessage, users } = useWebSocket(roomId);
  const { uploadFile } = useFileUpload();
  
  return (
    <div className="chat-room">
      <UserPresence users={users} />
      <MessageList messages={messages} />
      <MessageInput onSend={sendMessage} onFileUpload={uploadFile} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Backend (Node.js + Socket.io):**
```javascript
// Real-time message handling with persistence
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('join-room', async (roomId) => {
    await socket.join(roomId);
    const messages = await MessageService.getRecentMessages(roomId);
    socket.emit('message-history', messages);
  });
  
  socket.on('send-message', async (data) => {
    const message = await MessageService.createMessage(data);
    io.to(data.roomId).emit('new-message', message);
  });
});
```

#### Phase 3: QA Analysis with Playwright Integration

- ‚úÖ Use existing patterns and conventions
- ‚úÖ Leverage design system components

### For Moderate Features (4-8 hours)
- ‚úÖ Break into clear phases with checkpoints
- ‚úÖ Plan integration points carefully
- ‚úÖ Include performance considerations early
- ‚úÖ Add comprehensive error handling

### For Complex Features (8+ hours)
- ‚úÖ Involve architect persona for system design
- ‚úÖ Plan for multiple personas and coordination
- ‚úÖ Include security review for sensitive features
- ‚úÖ Plan E2E testing with Playwright integration
- ‚úÖ Consider breaking into multiple workflows

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Workflow stuck in "waiting_approval" phase
**Solution:** Check GitHub issue for approval comment format. Must be exactly `@langgraph approve`

**Issue:** Tests failing during development phase
**Solution:** Workflow should auto-fix test failures. If persistent, check error logs in state file

**Issue:** QA score consistently low (<80)
**Solution:** Review QA recommendations and adjust implementation patterns

**Issue:** Long execution times
**Solution:** Consider breaking complex features into multiple simpler workflows

### Recovery Commands

```bash
# Check workflow status
/geliz:state query --status active

# Resume interrupted workflow  
/geliz:orchestrator resume lg-20240131-abc123

# Manual GitHub sync
/geliz:github sync-state lg-20240131-abc123

# Emergency workflow reset
/geliz:state reset lg-20240131-abc123 --preserve-artifacts
```

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basic workflow:

1. **Customize Personas:** Adapt personas to your specific project needs
2. **Extend QA Rules:** Add project-specific quality gates and metrics
3. **Integrate CI/CD:** Connect with your existing development pipeline  
4. **Monitor Performance:** Track workflow metrics and optimize bottlenecks
5. **Train Team:** Ensure team understands approval processes and emergency controls

The LangGraph multi-agent workflow is designed to learn and improve over time. Each completed workflow contributes to better decision-making and more accurate estimates for future features.

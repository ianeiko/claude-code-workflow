- Plan agent handoff points and coordination mechanisms
- Identify parallel vs sequential execution opportunities
- Establish quality gates and validation checkpoints

**3. Resource Allocation**
- Estimate token usage across workflow phases
- Plan MCP server utilization (Sequential, Context7, Magic, Playwright)
- Allocate SuperClaude personas optimally
- Set realistic timeline expectations

**4. Risk Assessment & Mitigation**
- Identify potential workflow bottlenecks
- Plan for common failure scenarios
- Establish escalation and recovery procedures
- Define human intervention trigger points

**5. Success Criteria Definition**

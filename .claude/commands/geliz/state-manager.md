### State Operations

#### Initialize Workflow State
```
Create new workflow state file:

As a langgraph-expert, initialize workflow state:

Feature Request: $ARGUMENTS
Context: [Additional parameters]

Execute initialization:

1. **Generate Workflow ID:**
```bash
workflow_id="lg-$(date +%Y%m%d)-$(openssl rand -hex 4)"
state_file=".claude/tasks/${workflow_id}.md"
```

2. **Create State File:**
```bash
cat > "$state_file" << EOF
# LangGraph Workflow: [Feature Name]

## Workflow Metadata
- **Workflow ID:** $workflow_id
- **Feature Description:** [Feature request text]
- **Created:** $(date -Iseconds)
- **Last Updated:** $(date -Iseconds)
- **Status:** pending
- **Current Phase:** orchestrator
- **Priority:** medium
- **Complexity:** [determined by analysis]

[Additional sections with initial values...]
EOF
```

3. **Set Initial Permissions:**
```bash
chmod 644 "$state_file"
```

4. **Add to TodoWrite Tracking:**
Create corresponding TodoWrite entry for session tracking.
```

#### Update Workflow State
```
Update existing workflow state:

As a langgraph-expert, update workflow state:

Workflow ID: {workflow-id}
Update Data: {state changes}
Agent: {updating agent}

Execute update:

1. **Read Current State:**
```bash
state_file=".claude/tasks/${workflow_id}.md"
if [ ! -f "$state_file" ]; then
  echo "Error: State file not found"
  exit 1
fi
```

2. **Backup Current State:**
```bash
cp "$state_file" "${state_file}.backup-$(date +%s)"
```

3. **Apply Updates:**
Use Edit tool to update specific sections:
- Metadata (status, phase, timestamps)
- Agent status and outputs
- Quality metrics
- Timeline tracking
- Error log (if applicable)

4. **Validate State Consistency:**
Ensure all required fields are present and valid.

5. **Update Last Modified:**
```bash
sed -i "s/Last Updated:.*/Last Updated: $(date -Iseconds)/" "$state_file"
```
```

#### Query Workflow State
```
Retrieve and analyze workflow state:

As an analyzer, query workflow state:

Query Parameters: {what information is needed}
Filters: {status, agent, time range, etc.}

Execute query:

1. **Single Workflow Query:**
```bash
workflow_id="$1"
state_file=".claude/tasks/${workflow_id}.md"

if [ -f "$state_file" ]; then
  # Extract specific information
  grep "Status:" "$state_file"
  grep "Current Phase:" "$state_file"
  grep "QA Score:" "$state_file"
else
  echo "Workflow not found: $workflow_id"
fi
```

2. **Multi-Workflow Query:**
```bash
# Find all workflow files
find .claude/tasks -name "lg-workflow-*.md" | while read file; do
  echo "=== $(basename "$file") ==="
  grep -E "(Status|Current Phase|Created):" "$file"
  echo
done
```

3. **Status Dashboard:**
Generate real-time status dashboard showing:
- Active workflows and their phases
- Completed workflows in last 7 days
- Failed workflows requiring attention
- Average completion times by complexity
```

#### State Recovery Operations
```
Recover and resume interrupted workflows:

As a langgraph-expert, recover workflow state:

Recovery Scenario: {interruption type}
Workflow ID: {workflow-id}

Execute recovery:

1. **Assess State Integrity:**
```bash
workflow_id="$1"
state_file=".claude/tasks/${workflow_id}.md"

# Check file existence and readability
if [ ! -r "$state_file" ]; then
  echo "Cannot read state file: $state_file"
  exit 1
fi

# Validate state format
if ! grep -q "Workflow ID:" "$state_file"; then
  echo "Invalid state file format"
  exit 1
fi
```

2. **Identify Recovery Point:**
```bash
# Determine last successful phase
current_phase=$(grep "Current Phase:" "$state_file" | cut -d' ' -f3-)
last_update=$(grep "Last Updated:" "$state_file" | cut -d' ' -f3-)

echo "Last known phase: $current_phase"
echo "Last update: $last_update"
```

3. **Resume Workflow:**
Based on current phase:
- **orchestrator:** Re-run orchestration analysis
- **issue_creator:** Check GitHub issue status, resume if needed
- **dev_agent:** Assess implementation progress, continue from last checkpoint
- **qa_agent:** Re-run analysis if implementation changed
- **completion:** Verify completion status and artifacts

4. **Update Recovery Log:**
```bash
echo "- [$(date -Iseconds)] recovery: Workflow resumed from $current_phase phase" >> "$state_file"
```
```

### Cross-Session Continuity

#### Session Handoff Protocol
```
Manage workflow continuity across Claude Code sessions:

1. **Session Startup Check:**
```bash
# Check for active workflows
active_workflows=$(find .claude/tasks -name "lg-workflow-*.md" -exec grep -l "Status: in_progress\|Status: waiting_approval" {} \;)

if [ -n "$active_workflows" ]; then
  echo "Found active workflows:"
  echo "$active_workflows" | while read file; do
    workflow_id=$(basename "$file" .md)
    phase=$(grep "Current Phase:" "$file" | cut -d' ' -f3-)
    echo "  - $workflow_id (Phase: $phase)"
  done
fi
```

2. **Context Restoration:**
For each active workflow:
- Load workflow state and context
- Verify GitHub synchronization
- Check for pending human approvals
- Resume from appropriate phase

3. **State Synchronization:**
- Update timestamps for session restart
- Verify external state (GitHub, file system)
- Reconcile any discrepancies
- Log session handoff event
```

#### Workflow Persistence Strategies
```
Ensure workflow state survives system interruptions:

1. **Atomic State Updates:**
- Always backup before state changes
- Use temporary files for updates
- Atomic rename for final state update
- Verify state integrity after updates

2. **State Checkpointing:**
- Create checkpoints at major phase transitions
- Backup state before risky operations
- Maintain rolling backup history
- Enable rollback to any checkpoint

3. **External State Tracking:**
- Monitor GitHub for external changes
- Track file system modifications
- Detect divergence from expected state
- Reconcile discrepancies automatically
```

### State Analytics and Reporting

#### Workflow Performance Analytics
```
As an analyzer, generate workflow performance insights:

Time Period: {analysis period}
Workflow Filter: {complexity, status, etc.}

Generate analytics:

1. **Completion Rate Analysis:**
```bash
total_workflows=$(find .claude/tasks -name "lg-workflow-*.md" | wc -l)
completed_workflows=$(grep -l "Status: completed" .claude/tasks/lg-workflow-*.md | wc -l)
completion_rate=$((completed_workflows * 100 / total_workflows))

echo "Completion Rate: $completion_rate% ($completed_workflows/$total_workflows)"
```

2. **Average Duration Analysis:**
```bash
# Extract durations for completed workflows
grep -h "Actual Duration:" .claude/tasks/lg-workflow-*.md | \
  grep -v "pending" | \
  awk '{print $3}' | \
  # Calculate average duration
```

3. **Quality Metrics Trends:**
- Average QA scores over time
- Test coverage trends
- Error rates by phase
- Human intervention frequency

4. **Agent Performance Analysis:**
- Success rates by agent
- Average execution time by agent
- Error patterns and root causes
- Improvement opportunities
```
